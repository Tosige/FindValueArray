# Finding Values in Array List

Create an ArrayList that can hold Integers, and fill each slot with a different random value from 1-50. Display those values on the screen, and then prompt the user for an integer. Search through the ArrayList, and if the item is present, say so. It is not necessary to display anything if the value was not found. If the item is in the ArrayList multiple times, it's okay if the program prints the message more than once.

<b>Bonus:</b> Only display one message. Either: # was not found or # was found 5 times. (Or however many times that it occurs)
